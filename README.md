  and order fulfillment across global regions.This analysis will help identify delays,optimize shipping methods and improve customer satisfaction by ensuring
  on-time delivery and cost-effective logistics operations.

2.Tech stack:

A)Power BI Desktop - Data visualization platform used for report creation.
B)Power Query - Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
C)DAX(Data Analysis Expressions) - Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
D)Data Modelling - Rrlationship established among tables to enable filtering and aggregation.
E)File Format - .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.
